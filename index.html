<h3> Let's Begin</h3>
<p>Making tea for everyone is what making a website for programmers. <br>
It is a basic skill one must know.</p>
<p> And it is easier than making a website.<br>
You just need what you need and have to learn what to learn.</p>
<h3>You need Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Tea dust- Because how you will cook which is not there.</li>
    <li>Water- Beacause everything has water, even our bodies.</li>
    <li>Milk- Thats what British taught us.</li>
    <li>Sugar- keep it sweet, be it life or tea</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Boil the water- Must be hot as much as you're.</li>
    <li>Pouring milk- Unless you are making green tea, unlike Desi Indians.</li>
    <li>Pouring tea dust-Let that sink in(pun intended).</li>
    <li>Pouring sugar-otherwise its total waste-
         of time, hard work and taste</li>
</ol>
<h3>Typical Indian: Aage ka kya socha hai?</h3>
